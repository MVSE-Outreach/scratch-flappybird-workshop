\section{Programming the Bird}
In this section we are going to think about what code we should give our "Bird" sprite.

\subsection{Initialisation}
This just means how we want the bird to be set up when the game is started. Placing the bird back in the middle of the screen is a good idea:
\pic{0301-init}


\subsection{Gravity}
A simple way of giving the bird gravity would be to gradually reduce its y-coordinate, using this block:
\pic{0302-gravity}

\subsection{Flight}
We next need to decide on what we're going to use as input for this game. I chose the spacebar, so my code block for flight looks like:
\pic{0303-flight}
But you can choose any button you like.

\subsection{Animation}
Wouldn't it be cool if the bird's wings could flap when its flying? 
This can be easily done by switching between different costumes:
\pic{0304-nextcostume}
The Parrot Sprite that I'm using contains two costumes with the wings in different positions, but you can draw the different costumes if you prefer.

\subsection{Finished Code for Bird}
Therefore, the final code for the Bird sprite should look like this:
