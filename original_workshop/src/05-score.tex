\section{Scoring}
In this section, we will go through how to keep track of our Score in the game. To do this, we are going to use something called a "Variable", which is just a way to store information.

\subsection{Make a new Variable}
Go to to your obstacle sprite, and in the Data section, select "Make a Variable":
\pic{0501-makenewvariable}
\pic{0502-namevariable}

We want our Score to start at 0 each game, and then it to be increased by one each time a new obstacle is cloned, so add the orange data blocks to your code:
