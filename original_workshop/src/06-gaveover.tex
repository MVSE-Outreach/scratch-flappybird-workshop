\section{Game Over}
This section explains how you program the Bird sprite so that it can detect when it hits the ground or an obstacle.

Firstly you need to change the "forever" loop into a "repeat until" loop:
\pic{0601-repeatuntil}

Inside that we want to put an OR operator:
\pic{0602-or}

In both sides of this OR, we need "touching" sensors:
\pic{0603-touch}

After the loop, we want a "game over" message and the game to stop.

See if you can find those blocks yourself.

The final code should look something like this:

\pic{0605-finalgameover}
